        <h1>Diabetes Prediction Project</h1>
        <h2>Understanding the Project</h2>
        <p>This project is designed to predict whether a person has diabetes using machine learning. It analyzes health data to provide a risk assessment, helping individuals and healthcare professionals make more informed decisions. The project has two main components: data analysis and a user-friendly web app. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
    	<h2>How the Model Works</h2>
    	<p>
    	 The system works by using a machine learning model that is trained to understand the pattern between patient data and the likelihood of diabetes. Here's a simple breakdown:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Training</b>: The model is trained using a dataset with medical information of patients and if they have diabetes. This training process allows the model to understand the data and create a pattern for prediction.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>Prediction</b>: Once the model has learned the patterns, it can be used to predict if a new patient has diabetes by analyzing the same medical factors as the training data.
            </li>
            <li>
            <b>User Interface</b>: To make this model easy to use, a web application has been created that allows users to enter in the information required and get the result from the prediction model in real-time.
             </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
       <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Individual Predictions:</strong> Enter individual patient data (such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.) to get a prediction. This helps in individual risk assessment for diabetes.
           </li>
          <li>
               <strong>CSV Upload for Batch Analysis:</strong> Upload a CSV file containing data for multiple patients. The application will process all the rows and create a diabetes prediction for each one.
           </li>
            <li>
                 <strong>Search by Serial Number:</strong> Search for a specific patient using a unique identifier (serial number), and display their medical details, and the associated diabetes prediction.
           </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Add New Patient Feature:</strong> If the patient is not found, users can manually enter data to add a new patient with all their health information.
           </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>How to Use the Application</h2>
         <p>
            Using the application is designed to be intuitive. Here’s a step-by-step guide:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Enter Patient Data:</strong> Use the sidebar input fields to enter the health details of an individual. This includes metrics like glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.
               </li>
               <li>
                   <strong>Individual Prediction:</strong> Click the “Predict Diabetes” button to receive an immediate prediction on the chances of that individual having diabetes.
               </li>
                <li>
                   <strong>Uploading a CSV File:</strong> If you have data for multiple patients, you can upload a CSV file using the upload component in the sidebar.
                </li>
                <li>
                     <strong>Batch Prediction:</strong> Once the CSV is uploaded, the application will read each row, analyze the data and predict for each individual and display it.
                </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Searching for a Patient:</strong> Use the search bar by entering in a serial number to find a particular patient that you have added before either through an uploaded CSV or through the Add Patient Feature.
                </li>
                 <li>
                   <strong>Add New Patient:</strong> If a patient is not found, you will be prompted to add a new patient with the new data.
               </li>
            </ol>
    </div>
