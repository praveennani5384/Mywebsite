        <h1>SQL Capstone Project</h1>
        <p>This project involves performing various analytical queries on NFT sales data using SQL. The data includes information about CryptoPunk sales, such as sale prices, dates, buyer addresses, and seller addresses. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from this data using complex SQL queries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>The dataset utilized in this project pertains to CryptoPunk NFT sales, encompassing details such as transaction dates, prices in both ETH and USD, as well as the addresses of both buyers and sellers. The primary objective was to leverage SQL for in-depth analysis, thereby extracting significant patterns and business-oriented insights.</p>
           
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Key Queries and Insights</h2>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Total Sales Count:</strong> Determined the total number of sales within a specified date range.</li>
            <li><strong>Top 5 Transactions:</strong> Identified the top 5 most expensive transactions based on USD price, and also extracted the name, ETH price, USD price and date of the transactions</li>
            <li><strong>Moving Average Price:</strong> Calculated the moving average of USD price over the last 50 transactions which provided trend analysis on the price changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Average Sale Price by NFT:</strong> Determined each NFT's average sales price, sorted in descending order, highlighting the top-performing NFTs.</li>
            <li><strong>Sales by Day of the Week:</strong> Provided analysis of sales by each day of the week and their average price in ETH, ordered by the number of transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Summary:</strong> Constructed a descriptive summary of each transaction with all the relevant details such as name of the NFT, buyer, seller, date and the price.</li>
            <li><strong>View Creation:</strong> Created a database view “1919_purchases” to filter the sales from a given address.</li>
            <li><strong>ETH Price Histogram:</strong> Categorized ETH price ranges, creating a histogram to illustrate price frequency.</li>
            <li><strong>High and Low Sale Prices:</strong> Generated a unified query that shows the highest and lowest purchase prices for each NFT.</li>
           <li><strong>Monthly Top NFT Sales:</strong> Determined the NFT with the highest sales count and the maximum sale price for a given month and year.</li>
            <li><strong>Monthly Total Volume:</strong>  Calculated the total sales volume on a monthly basis.</li>
           <li><strong>Wallet Transaction Count:</strong> Determined number of sales made by a given wallet address as a buyer, seller and total transactions.</li>
           <li><strong>Estimated Average Value Calculation:</strong> Built a robust value calculator that filters out outliers in daily sales and calculates a representative average price.</li>
           <li><strong>Wallet Profitability:</strong> Determined the overall profitability (or loss) of each wallet, ordered by the most profitable.</li>
